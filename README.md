Giphy API Demo (Search API Endpoint)

### App Info
On initial page load there are predefined buttons with superhero names, you can add more buttons by using the add button area on top of the page.

Upon clicking a button 10 gifs will be displayed on the page, in case you don't see the gif that you like you can load more by clicking the show more button at the bottom of the page.

Clicking the image will trigger the gif to start moving, clicking it again will stop it. You can also add a gif to your liked/faved list by clicking the little heart icon below the image. The like/faved feature uses localstorage to store the list of gifs you like so even after a refresh or if the browser is closed and opened again your liked/faved gifs will still be marked properly.
